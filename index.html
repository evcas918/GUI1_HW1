        <h2>What is the UEFA Champions League?</h2>
        <p>The UEFA Champions League is the premier club competition in European football. Since its birth in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup, it has evolved into the most prestigious club tournament in Europe, maybe even in the world. Top teams from all around Europe are invited to play. 81 teams in the 2024-2025 season got invited to play, but there is a large qualifying tournament before the real tournament even begins to decide 36 teams who will play in a 8 game long league phase. These games are decided randomly via a drawing. By the end of these 8 rounds of games, the top 8 teams automatically make it to the round of 16, while teams from 9th place to 24th place play in a “knockout phase playoffs”. Here teams play 2 legs against 1 team (one at each team’s home stadium) and whoever scores more goals on aggregate moves on to the round of 16. Once all these games are finished and all 16 teams are confirmed for the round of 16, another drawing takes place to determine the matchups. The remaining matchups all have 2 legs, and the losing teams get eliminated. The rounds go as follows: round of 16 -> quarter finals -> semi finals -> finale (which is only 1 single game at a neutral site). Currently this year’s tournament is almost over, and the finale is on 5/31/2025. View this year’s knockout bracket below:</p>

        <h2>Evolution Over Time</h2>
        <p>Dating back all the way to the mid-1950s, a European Cup was born. Its inaugural season was 1955-56 and there were only 16 teams invited to play, and Real Madrid won. This continued for many years, and as its popularity increased, the competition expanded too, seeing more teams get invited to play each year. Eventually in the 1992-93 season, the tournament was rebranded as the UEFA Champions league (Union of European Football Associations). This change skyrocketed the popularity of the Champions League, there were more games, more games on TV, and incredible stories happening year in and year out. The champions league as it stands in 2025 is the largest club soccer tournament in the world, and one of the most viewed sporting events too. Fans live and die by their teams and ultras (elite fans for a team) leave everything out in the stadium including chants, huge intimidating or motivating tifos (large flags held by spectators *photo below*). This tournament is extremely iconic, and it brings so many people all around the world together. </p>
